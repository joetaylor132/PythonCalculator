# PythonCalculator
A simple python calculator 

Hey, this simple python calculator was made by me (Joe Taylor) on Sunday 2nd December 2018
due to the simplicity of this programme i haven't commented on the code to explain what exactly each
part of code does...
However if  you're sturggling to understand the code or would like me to update it with a commmented version then
feel free to contact me :)

Hope this helps enthusiasts, students and whoever else it ma benefit!
